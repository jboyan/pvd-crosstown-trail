# PVD Crosstown Trail Map

Wayfinding map for the Providence, RI Crosstown Trail. This map app is based on Chris Whong's map of [the great saunter](https://shorewalkers.org/great-saunter/). It includes the route itself along with markers for restrooms, landmarks, and other waypoints. It is optimized for view on mobile devices and includes a "follow the user" mode that will keep the map centered on the user's location.
